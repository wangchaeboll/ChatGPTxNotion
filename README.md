# 📋 ChatGPT X Notion

A beginner-friendly Chrome extension that adds a copy button to LaTeX equations on webpages — made with simplicity, readability, and learning in mind.

## ⚡️If you're new to Chrome extensions or JavaScript classes, this repo is for you.

# 🌟Why This Stands Out
This is not just another extension. This is my first project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript — a small but meaningful milestone in my coding journey.

Inspired by enoobis and his pinned extension, most of the structure here is refactored and adapted from his clean, modular approach.

✅ Built using **classes** for better structure

✅ No bloated frameworks — just **raw** JavaScript 

✅ Easy-to-read for beginners learning how to build extensions 

✅ Focused on one simple feature — copying LaTeX expressions 

# 🧠Who Is This For?
This repo is especially useful if:

You’re trying to learn how to make **Chrome extensions**

You want a minimal, readable starting point

You’re curious how to use classes in a real-world mini project

You're tired of tutorials that are either too basic or too advanced

📸 Demo


See the little copy icon? Click it and your LaTeX is copied to clipboard. That’s it. Simple and effective.

# 🛠How It Works (Brief)
The script runs on pages with LaTeX (like katex-display spans).

It uses a class to modularize the logic:

Detect LaTeX blocks

Append a copy button

Handle clipboard logic

Written in plain JavaScript with minimal DOM manipulation

# 📚Credits & Inspiration
Big thanks to enoobis — his pinned repo taught me the value of clean code and project structure.

# ✨Final Words
This is more than a copy button. It’s a reflection of learning how to code the right way — with structure, clarity, and inspiration.
